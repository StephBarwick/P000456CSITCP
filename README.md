GENERATIVE AI DETECTION ON HATESPEECH DATASET 

- GitHub URL https://github.com/StephBarwick/P000456CSITCP.git
- Ensure python version 3.9+ is used
- Ensure all files in the folder is downloaded to the same loaction as the jupyternotebook model_extend.ipynb.
- Files to download:
   - TwitteHate.csv: Dataset with hate speech tweets 
   - en.txt: Swear words dataset list (used in hybrid inference)
  - twitter.csv: Dataset of different classfied tweets
  - The model.ipynb is without the BERT model and hyrbid inference if the LTSM is only of interest as the BERT model can take some time to run. 
  are in the same location as model_extend.ipynb on your machine.
- Run the code from the begining of the file although the jupyter notebook is already full ran.
- If the code needs to be ran again ensure it is re ran from the beginning to avoid errors and allow for all packages to be imported.
